# Figma Examples

This scope shows a collection of components that contain Figma embeds so developers can easily see designs right next to their components. If designers change anything then this will be seen live directly in the UI. Developers can zoom in or out of the design or can click the link at the bottom which will take the direct to the Figma file so they can inspect the CSS etc.

Designers can choose to create their components in separate files or as frames and then share the embed url.
